    "1: \"Application Programming Interface\"\n",
    "  API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols, routines,\n",
    "and tools for building software applications, which allows different software programs\n",
    "to communicate with each other.\n",
    "#Examples:    \n",
    "    1.An example of an API in real life is when we use a mobile app to book a ride with \n",
    "a ride-hailing service like Uber or rapido. The app uses the ride-hailing services API\n",
    "to send and receive information between the app and the services servers.\n",
    "  The API allows the app to display information about available drivers, estimate \n",
    "fares, and request rides, while the ride-hailing services servers handle the logistics\n",
    "of matching riders with drivers and processing payments.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   2. Another example of an API is the Google Maps API, which allows developers to\n",
    "integrate Google Maps functionality into their own applications.\n",
    " This allows developers to add maps, directions, and location-based features to \n",
    "    their apps without having to build the functionality from scratch.\n",

    "        and data.\n",
